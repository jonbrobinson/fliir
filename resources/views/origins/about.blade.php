            <p>Fliir is born for the idea of being independent and free.  Fliir is looking to curate to the best experiences for people around the city.
            We know there are great opportunities in every city and hope to connect great people with missed opportunities</p>

            <p>Fliir originated when the the founder realized he was missing some of the great events around the city.
                Rather than depend on other cites to tell him what was going on He decided to create a site that would help find the events that he would enjoy.
            </p>

            <p>
                Fliir curates its content by searching the internet for great experiences and jobs for its users.
                It is important that Events represent a certain mind set of truly wanted experiences.
